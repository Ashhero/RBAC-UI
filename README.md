Implementing Core Requirements for the User Management System
Below is a breakdown of how the Core Requirements can be implemented in the current project:

1. User Management
Features:
View Users: Use a Material-UI DataGrid to display users in a tabular format.
Add Users:
Include a button ("Add User") that opens a form dialog to input user details like name, email, role, and status.
Save the user via the mock API or update the state directly for simulation.
Edit Users:
Allow editing user details through a dialog populated with the existing data.
Save changes to the user list upon confirmation.
Delete Users:
Include a delete button for Admin roles to remove users.
Show a confirmation dialog before deletion.
Manage Status:
Add a toggle (Active/Inactive) for users and store it in the user object.
Implementation:
Components:
UserManagement.jsx: Displays the user table and manages Add/Edit/Delete operations.
RoleDialog.jsx: Reuse for adding and editing users with fields like name, email, role, and status.
2. Role Management
Features:
Define Roles:
Provide a form to create new roles with name and permissions.
Edit Roles:
Allow modification of existing roles (e.g., changing permissions).
Assign Permissions:
Include permissions like Read, Write, and Delete for each role. These can be displayed as checkboxes in the role management dialog.
Implementation:
Components:

RoleManagement.jsx: A new component for managing roles.
RoleDialog.jsx: Extend functionality to handle role creation and editing.
Mock API Updates:

Add functions like fetchRoles, addRole, and updateRole to simulate backend operations for roles.
3. Dynamic Permissions
Features:
Assign Permissions to Roles:
Define roles with specific permissions (e.g., Admin has all permissions, Editor has Read and Write, Viewer has only Read).
Modify Permissions:
Allow updates to the permissions of existing roles via a simple form or UI.
Display Permissions:
Use a list or checkbox UI to show the permissions associated with each role.
Implementation:
Components:

Add a permission management UI in the role dialog to display and modify permissions dynamically.
Data Structure Updates:

Ensure each role in the mock API has a permissions array.
4. Custom API Simulation (Optional)
Features:
Mock CRUD Operations:
Use in-memory arrays to simulate a backend server.
Provide functions like fetchUsers, fetchRoles, addUser, addRole, etc., to mimic API calls.
